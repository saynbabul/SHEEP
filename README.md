Codes associated to the paper SHEEP, a Signed Hamiltonian Eigenvector Embedding for Proximity

Abstract: 

Signed network embedding methods allow for a low-dimensional representation of nodes and primarily focus on partitioning the graph into clusters, hence losing information on continuous node attributes. Here, we introduce a spectral embedding algorithm for understanding proximal relationships between nodes in signed graphs, where edges can take either positive or negative weights. Inspired by a physical model, we construct our embedding as the minimum energy configuration of a Hamiltonian dependent on the distance between nodes and locate the optimal embedding dimension. We show through a series of experiments on synthetic and empirical networks, that our method (SHEEP) can recover continuous node attributes
showcasing its main advantages: re-configurability into a computationally efficient eigenvector problem, retrieval of ground state energy which can be used as a statistical test for the presence of strong balance, and measure of node extremism, computed as the distance to the origin in the optimal embedding.
